# About

This repo is from the lab assignments of MIT 6.824 Distributed Systems, which is a collection of code written in Go. 
Check out the link for more: http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2021/index.html

The repo here is for practicing and learning certain concepts of Distributed Systems, which can also help record my progress in learning this course.
